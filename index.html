    <p>
        The Labradoodle is perhaps the first “designer dog,” 
        making it a more recent (and extremely popular) addition to the canine kingdom. 
        A cross between the family-friendly Labrador and the good-natured Poodle.
        Labradoodles are friendly and love people. 
        They also possess a unique ability to gauge the needs of those around them
